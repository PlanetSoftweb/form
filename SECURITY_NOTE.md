# Security Configuration Note

## Super Admin Panel - API Key Security

### Current Setup (SECURE)
- **Read Access**: ONLY kevalsavaliya2222@gmail.com can read the API key from Firestore
- **Write Access**: ONLY kevalsavaliya2222@gmail.com can update the API key
- **Firestore Rules**: Enforced at database level

### How It Works

#### For Admin (kevalsavaliya2222@gmail.com):
1. Login to your account
2. Go to /super-admin
3. View and update API key
4. Changes are saved to Firestore
5. AI features work using Firestore key

#### For Other Users:
- They CANNOT access the Firestore API key
- AI features will use the environment variable `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` as fallback
- **You must set this in Netlify** for other users to use AI features

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Step 2: Setup Environment Variable (Required)
Go to Netlify Dashboard:
1. Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add variable:
   - Key: `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - Value: `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`
3. Redeploy

#### Step 3: Admin Can Override (Optional)
1. Login as admin (kevalsavaliya2222@gmail.com)
2. Go to /super-admin
3. Save API key in Firestore
4. Admin's AI features will use Firestore key
5. Other users still use environment variable

### Security Level: HIGH ✅

- ✅ Only admin email can access Firestore key
- ✅ Database rules prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ No hardcoded passwords
- ✅ Email-based authentication
- ✅ Environment variable fallback for non-admin users

### Trade-offs

**Current Approach (Recommended)**:
- ✅ Maximum security
- ✅ Only admin sees Firestore key
- ⚠️ Requires Netlify env variable for other users

**Alternative (Not Recommended)**:
- Allow all users to read key from Firestore
- ✅ No Netlify setup needed
- ❌ Any authenticated user can steal the key
- ❌ Security risk

**We chose the secure approach** - Only admin can access Firestore, others use env variable.
